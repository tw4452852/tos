# MEGS
# Set the number of Megabytes of physical memory you want to emulate. 
# The default is 32MB, most OS's won't need more than that.
# The maximum amount of memory supported is 2048Mb.
# The 'MEGS' option is deprecated. Use 'MEMORY' option instead.

# ROMIMAGE:
# The ROM BIOS controls what the PC does when it first powers on.
# Normally, you can use a precompiled BIOS in the source or binary
# distribution called BIOS-bochs-latest. The ROM BIOS is usually loaded
# starting at address 0xf0000, and it is exactly 64k long. Another option
# is 128k BIOS which is loaded at address 0xe0000.
# You can also use the environment variable $BXSHARE to specify the
# location of the BIOS.
# The usage of external large BIOS images (up to 512k) at memory top is
# now supported, but we still recommend to use the BIOS distributed with
# Bochs. The start address optional, since it can be calculated from image size.
#=======================================================================

# VGAROMIMAGE
# You now need to load a VGA ROM BIOS into C0000.

# FLOPPYA:
# Point this to pathname of floppy image file or device
# This should be of a bootable floppy(image/device) if you're
# booting from 'a' (or 'floppy').
#
# You can set the initial status of the media to 'ejected' or 'inserted'.
#   floppya: 2_88=path, status=ejected    (2.88M 3.5"  media)
#   floppya: 1_44=path, status=inserted   (1.44M 3.5"  media)
#   floppya: 1_2=path, status=ejected     (1.2M  5.25" media)
#   floppya: 720k=path, status=inserted   (720K  3.5"  media)
#   floppya: 360k=path, status=inserted   (360K  5.25" media)
#   floppya: 320k=path, status=inserted   (320K  5.25" media)
#   floppya: 180k=path, status=inserted   (180K  5.25" media)
#   floppya: 160k=path, status=inserted   (160K  5.25" media)
#   floppya: image=path, status=inserted  (guess media type from image size)
#   floppya: 1_44=vvfat:path, status=inserted  (use directory as VFAT media)
#   floppya: type=1_44                    (1.44M 3.5" floppy drive, no media)
#
# The path should be the name of a disk image file.  On Unix, you can use a raw
# device name such as /dev/fd0 on Linux.  On win32 platforms, use drive letters
# such as a: or b: as the path.  The parameter 'image' works with image files
# only. In that case the size must match one of the supported types.
# The parameter 'type' can be used to enable the floppy drive without media
# and status specified. Usually the drive type is set up based on the media type.
# The optional parameter 'write_protected' can be used to control the media
# write protect switch. By default it is turned off.

# ATA[0-3]-MASTER, ATA[0-3]-SLAVE
#
# This defines the type and characteristics of all attached ata devices:
#   type=       type of attached device [disk|cdrom] 
#   mode=       only valid for disks [flat|concat|external|dll|sparse|vmware3]
#                                    [vmware4|undoable|growing|volatile|vpc|vvfat]
#   path=       path of the image / directory
#   cylinders=  only valid for disks
#   heads=      only valid for disks
#   spt=        only valid for disks
#   status=     only valid for cdroms [inserted|ejected]
#   biosdetect= type of biosdetection [none|auto], only for disks on ata0 [cmos]
#   translation=type of translation of the bios, only for disks [none|lba|large|rechs|auto]
#   model=      string returned by identify device command
#   journal=    optional filename of the redolog for undoable, volatile and vvfat disks
#
# Point this at a hard disk image file, cdrom iso file, or physical cdrom
# device.  To create a hard disk image, try running bximage.  It will help you
# choose the size and then suggest a line that works with it.
#
# In UNIX it may be possible to use a raw device as a Bochs hard disk, 
# but WE DON'T RECOMMEND IT.  In Windows there is no easy way.
#
# In windows, the drive letter + colon notation should be used for cdroms.
# Depending on versions of windows and drivers, you may only be able to 
# access the "first" cdrom in the system.  On MacOSX, use path="drive"
# to access the physical drive.
#
# The path is mandatory for hard disks. Disk geometry autodetection works with
# images created by bximage if CHS is set to 0/0/0 (cylinders are calculated
# using  heads=16 and spt=63). For other hard disk images and modes the
# cylinders, heads, and spt are mandatory. In all cases the disk size reported
# from the image must be exactly C*H*S*512.
#
# Default values are:
#   mode=flat, biosdetect=auto, translation=auto, model="Generic 1234"
#
# The biosdetect option has currently no effect on the bios
#
# Examples:
#   ata0-master: type=disk, mode=flat, path=10M.sample, cylinders=306, heads=4, spt=17
#   ata0-slave:  type=disk, mode=flat, path=20M.sample, cylinders=615, heads=4, spt=17
#   ata1-master: type=disk, mode=flat, path=30M.sample, cylinders=615, heads=6, spt=17
#   ata1-slave:  type=disk, mode=flat, path=46M.sample, cylinders=940, heads=6, spt=17
#   ata2-master: type=disk, mode=flat, path=62M.sample, cylinders=940, heads=8, spt=17
#   ata2-slave:  type=disk, mode=flat, path=112M.sample, cylinders=900, heads=15, spt=17
#   ata3-master: type=disk, mode=flat, path=483M.sample, cylinders=1024, heads=15, spt=63
#   ata3-slave:  type=cdrom, path=iso.sample, status=inserted

# BOOT:
# This defines the boot sequence. Now you can specify up to 3 boot drives,
# which can be 'floppy', 'disk', 'cdrom' or 'network' (boot ROM).
# Legacy 'a' and 'c' are also supported.
# Examples:
#   boot: floppy
#   boot: cdrom, disk
#   boot: network, disk
#   boot: cdrom, floppy, disk
#=======================================================================
boot: disk
#=======================================================================
# LOG:
# Give the path of the log file you'd like Bochs debug and misc. verbiage
# to be written to. If you don't use this option or set the filename to
# '-' the output is written to the console. If you really don't want it,
# make it "/dev/null" (Unix) or "nul" (win32). :^(
#
# Examples:
#   log: ./bochs.out
#   log: /dev/tty
#=======================================================================
